                    Direct Learning is instantiated in a modular engine Rokio calls DataShapes. DataShapes modules support the rapid development and
                    the deployment of “Shapes” applications as services.
                    Rokio believes that, while Intelligence at the Edge is important, maximizing the Intelligence we derive from our Edge assets is an
                    even more important objective. Shapes, the term we apply to DataShapes applications, are revolutionary, not only in their performance as
                    Edge Intelligence applications but also in their ability to automatically transform, reduce and transmit sensor data as robust structured data
                    for off-Edge big data, data search and neural net training applications. Rokio calls these two functional propositions and software as a service
                    products Shapes Data and Shapes Intelligence.

                    Rokio’s Shapes Data application service will be of universal enterprise value in unleashing “Dark” (unstructured) data lost or trapped
                    in or highly constrained by the Edge. Shapes Data is a revolutionary, device-embeddable data product enabling any sensor data to be automatically
                    transformed to structured data, hosted with additional metrological, meta and relevant source data, reduced by up to 100x and transmitted for use at
                    tactical operations centers or the Cloud. Components of Shapes Data are used by our Shapes Intelligence application service to produce Edge Intelligence results.

                    Shapes Intelligence as a service is a rapidly deployable suite of Edge device utilities delivering unprecedented features and performance for
                    any type of sensor data. Shapes Intelligence addresses two common Edge use-cases; anomaly detection (aka condition monitoring) and recognition.
                    Shapes Intelligence is uniquely capable of performing anomaly detection because the application is capable of learning-on-the-fly in real-time,
                    continuously learning “normal”, enabling alerts that are more meaningful than alerts from a fixed Deep Learning model that can only issue alerts
                    based on ‘off-grid’ training. DataShapes’ additional capabilities; zero-cloud reliance, high frequency data processing, auditability and contextualization,
                    create a value proposition that is highly differentiated from conventional machine learning and can deliver “next generation” performance at the Edge.
